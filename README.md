Hey Yall this is a fork of the Excellent Pokemon GO map

The idea is to add  a desktop gui to streamline new users in a way

you need to run pip install -r requirments.txt to get all the needd python things

in addtion you need to download PyQT 4 for Python version 2.7 to actually get the GUI to work

This is the intial upload so expect the process to be streamlined as times goes on
